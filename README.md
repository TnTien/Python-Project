# Basic Python Projects
These are some of the basic projects writtin in Python that I did with the Tech Academy. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.
## Projects:
* [Phonebook](https://github.com/TnTien/Python-Project/tree/main/file_transfer)
* [File Transfer GUI](https://github.com/TnTien/Python-Project/tree/main/phonebook_project)

### Phonebook
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
### File Transfer GUI
This project allows the user to transfer files from one directory to another. The user will first select a directory and the program will check whether any of the files has been modified within 24 hours. The files that has been modified within 24 hours will then get transfered to the destination directory.
